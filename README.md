# DojoAssignments
This is a mixture of the MEAN, .NET, and Python stacks. It is a meant as a library of various assignments
that I finished during my time in school. I am leaving this here to show coding ability in multiple
languages, as well as to reference code snippets that I need for other projects.

This code is available for use by anyone and anything. Unless you are a Dojo student. Try not to cheat too much ;)
